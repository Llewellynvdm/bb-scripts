bb-scripts => brightspace status

1) Obsolete/deleted scripts

These scripts interacted directly with BlackBoard (using curl/sed), and are thus so closely related to the (lack of) functionality that that system provided that they will not be useful:

- bblogin2.sh
- assignta.sh
- getsch.sh
- bbfix.sh
- upload.sh
- mksdir.sh
- hak2.sh (replaced by hak3.sh!)

Also, xmail.sh was deleted, because it was a silly script.

2) Disabled scripts

These scripts require the present of the "Blackboard response files" (the famed s*/s*.txt), or a list of usernames+email addresses to function.
The functionality they provided may be quite useful, but we need to find out what a good "best practice" is with Brightspace before porting them.

- antifmt.sh
- count.sh
- stats.sh
- groepjes.sh
- collectplag.sh

These scripts are most likely unnecessary in the future:

- verdeel.sh
- wizard.sh
- feedback.sh
  - grades.sh
  - mailto.sh

3) Scripts that should work without modifications.

- jarify.sh
- iching.sh
- pol.sh
- rgrade.sh
- trialc.sh

4) NEW scripts

- hak3.sh
	sorts *all subdirectories* into fresh bins (hak2.sh only sorted s-directories)
	note: this probably also need to split/distribute the index.html that brightspace gives us
- dupes.sh 
	finds possible duplicate handins in C++/Java code)
